DESCRIPTION
------------------

In the span of a few years, cryptocurrencies have grown from digital novelties to trillion-dollar technologies with the potential to disrupt the global financial system. Bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are increasingly held as investments, and they are used to buy everything from software to real estate to illegal transactions. Now and in the next couple of years, you'll see a lot of interest and adoption of cryptocurrency by investors as an investment tool, namely as a hedge against inflation and as an alternative to gold. Thus one needs to be keep up with the trend and in The project order to do so have to be current on the facts about the cryptocurrency market. My project was inspired by this crypto verse and is intended to update you about the current trends, the popular crypto currencies , their exchange rates, the latest news in the world of crypto and so on . Web3.0 is taking the world by a storm .This shift will enable a whole new wave of previously unimaginable businesses and business models: from global co-operatives to decentralized autonomous organizations and self-sovereign data marketplaces. Thus keeping up with this trend , I tried to create a platform for users to have a good experience and get all the information they need at one stop. Since the information is real time , it keeps updating with ups and downs in the crypto world.
